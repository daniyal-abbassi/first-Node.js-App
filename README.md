# Project: Basic Informational Site

**NodeJS Course**

## Description

This project is a simple informational website built with Node.js. It serves four basic HTML pages: `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact-me.html`, and `404.html`.

## Assignment

1.  **Create Project Files:**
    * Create a project directory.
    * Inside the directory, create the following HTML files:
        * `index.html`
        * `about.html`
        * `contact-me.html`
        * `404.html`
2.  **Create Node.js Server:**
    * Create a Node.js server file named `index.js`.
    * Add code to serve the correct HTML page based on the URL:
        * `localhost:8080` should serve `index.html`.
        * `localhost:8080/about` should serve `about.html`.
        * `localhost:8080/contact-me` should serve `contact-me.html`.
        * Any other URL should serve `404.html`.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2.  Create the HTML files and `index.js` in a project directory.
3.  Open a terminal in the project directory.
4.  Run `node index.js`.
5.  Open your browser and navigate to:
    * `http://localhost:8080`
    * `http://localhost:8080/about`
    * `http://localhost:8080/contact-me`
    * Any other URL for the 404 page.
